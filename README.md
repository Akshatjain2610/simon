# simon
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

**GAMEPLAY**
The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
